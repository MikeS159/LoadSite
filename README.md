# LoadSite
Loads all website pages from a sitemap

The script file contains an example of how to load all pages of a site using a sitemap. It should work for similar style sitemaps.
If a sitemap has the word “index” in it, it will treat it as a list of further sitemaps and try to read each one. If it doesn’t then it will try and load the page of each link found in the site map page.
